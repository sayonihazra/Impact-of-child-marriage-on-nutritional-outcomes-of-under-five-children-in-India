This research project titled "Impact of Child Marriage on Nutritional Outcomes of Under-Five Children in India" examines the causal relationship between early maternal age—through child marriage and adolescent pregnancy—and child malnutrition, using nationally representative data from the National Family Health Survey (NFHS-5, 2019–21). Employing probit and IV probit regression models along with spatial analysis, the study assesses how early marriage and pregnancy affect four key anthropometric indicators: stunting, wasting, underweight, and the Composite Index of Anthropometric Failure (CIAF). It also investigates whether these effects vary across socio-economic groups, education levels, caste/religious communities, and geographical regions, controlling for a comprehensive set of demographic, environmental, and maternal health variables.

The findings reveal that children born to women who experienced child marriage are significantly more likely to suffer from malnutrition across all indicators, with stunting and underweight being particularly pronounced. Similarly, adolescent pregnancy further exacerbates these risks. Interestingly, the negative impacts are often more severe among mothers with higher education and wealth, suggesting complex intra-household dynamics and cultural factors at play. Spatial mapping shows a significant overlap between regions with high rates of child marriage and poor child health outcomes, especially in Northern India. The study highlights the urgent need for targeted policy interventions to delay age at marriage and first pregnancy, improve maternal health, and reduce intergenerational malnutrition—critical for achieving India’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
